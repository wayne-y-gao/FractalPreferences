# FractalHeterogeneity

``The Fractal Nature and the Hausdorff Dimension of Individual Heterogeneity''

A Vibe Research Project for Fun!

Description of Vibe Research Workflow:

This is a _vibe research_ project. The project started with a back-and-forth voice chat between me and Gemini Live as a continuation of the Twitter/X essay ``Towards a Distributed Knowledge Atmosphere'' (Gao 2026), while I was going through PhD admission files, drafting undergraduate midterm exam questions, and revising a working paper on submanifold integrals with respect to the Hausdorff measure (Chen & Gao, 2025). A Gemini-generated summary of our conversation was then sent to Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT in their respective Deep Research/Think mode for initial drafts, which were then integrated together by Claude. The draft was then reviewed by Refine.ink, Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT, whose comments were addressed, incorporated, or dismisseed by Claude. I then edited multiple parts of the drafts by hand and by prompts, with an emphasis on the ideas rather than the details.
	
While the draft's starting point and main directions of inquires reflect my intentions, I have not fully reviewed the content in its entirety and cannot attest to its full correctness (partly because some of the concepts and results require background knowledge beyond my current knowledge). To summarize, this is a good-faith effort whose primary goal is to be thought-provoking---to sketch connections, pose questions, and invite intellectual adventure---rather than to meet the standard of fully rigorous academic research. Readers should treat it more as a science-fiction novel than an academic working paper, at least in its current form.
